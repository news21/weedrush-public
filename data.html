<h2>Marijuana on Twitter</h2>
<p>Opinions tweeted about cannabis over several years show <a href="{{ site.data.urls.cannabisculture.url }}#cannabismap"> consistency in supporting more relaxed marijuana laws </a>, but an evolution in the topics most discussed. The business and industry of marijuana, as well as political advocacy favoring the issue, <a href="{{ site.data.urls.cannabisculture.url }}#topicmap"> have increasingly become the focus of those using Twitter</a> to discuss cannabis. At the same time, health has become less of a concern. States with more relaxed marijuana laws also <a href="{{ site.data.urls.cannabisculture.url }}#cannabis1map"> show more Twitter activity </a> on the topic.</p>

<h2>Los Angeles' dispensary chase</h2>
<p>In Southern California's most populous city, law enforcement has closed down dispensaries only to have them open elsewhere - a nearly futile effort to tighten regulations on an industry largely unchecked. Research done at UCLA shows <a href="{{ site.data.urls.california.url }}#californiamap"> the dispensaries moved into lower income and minority dense areas as police cracked down on dispensaries in other communities.</a> </p>

<h2>Marijuana-related Stop, Question and Frisk activity</h2>
<p>Between 2007 and 2014, New York City police stopped, questioned and frisked people around 3.7 million times. Only a fraction of those stops - about 150,000 - had some relation to marijuana. But <a href="{{ site.data.urls.newyork.url }}#nymap"> when data from the New York City Police Department and the United States Census Bureau is mapped over eight years</a>, clusters of marijuana-related police stops map closely to minority-dense areas.</p>
